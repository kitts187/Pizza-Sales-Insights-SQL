# Pizza-Sales-Insights-SQL

This project involves analyzing a pizza sales dataset to gain insights into customer preferences, sales trends, and revenue patterns. 
Using SQL, I explored and answered various business-related questions that can assist stakeholders in making data-driven decisions.
Dataset Overview:
The dataset contains tables related to pizza orders, including details about pizza types, sizes, prices, and order information. 
The analysis leverages multiple tables through SQL joins and aggregate functions.
Tools Used:
SQL: Primary language used for data analysis.
Database Management System: MySQL.
Future Scope:
Add visualizations using Power BI or Tableau.
Perform predictive analysis to forecast sales trends.
Enhance the dataset with customer feedback for sentiment analysis.
